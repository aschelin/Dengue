In this project we analyse data concerning **dengue cases** in the Federal District of Brazil. 

Among the various health problems that affect Brazil and, particularly the central west, Dengue stands out as one of the main challenges to be overcome. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 2/5 of the world population is subjected to contracting the disease. 

Each year, *50 million* new cases occur. Of these, about half a million people are hospitalized and 20,000 die. In general, the clinical picture of the infection is diverse, ranging from **asymptomatic to severe hemorrhagic fever**.

The dengue virus is transmitted by arthropods that include four different serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). **It enters the host organism through the skin after an infected mosquito bite**. Transmission between humans occurs by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and occurs mainly during the rainy season.

**The contagion dynamics of dengue is associated with climatic variations**. We can mention some factors that contribute to the development of the vector: the increase in temperature, variations in precipitation and relative humidity. There are two stages in the development of the vector: the aquatic, with stages of development of egg, larva and pupa, and the terrestrial, which corresponds to the adult mosquito. Both stages are subject to environmental and meteorological changes.

In Brazil, dengue appeared between 1981 and 1982, in the city of Boa Vista, State of Roraima. Since then, the country has recorded several epidemic outbreaks. Currently, it is already possible to find Aedes aegypti in the 27 federal units, with more than 3,587 municipalities infested by the vector of the disease. **Dengue, therefore, has been an important cause of mortality in recent decade**s.
